#  About Me
Hi! I am Zain — An Electronics & Embedded Systems Engineer based in the United Kingdom. 
I am currently a recent graduate of University of Liverpool working towards developing next generation of embedded hardware solutions making custom hardware solutions cheaper, safer, and reliable.

Highly skilled in a variety of PCB design & SPICE simulation softwares as well as embedded software development. My background has also seen a strong development in analog & digital electronic system design and quality control (ISO 9000).

Proven history of ownership and results in multiple organisations. My primary focus is to expand my knowledge in as many areas as possible so as to better myself as a leader and ensure I am always pushing my potential further.

##  Work Experience
###  Hardware Design Engineer | eSpark Consultancy Group | 2023 - 2024 | Karachi, Pakistan
  ● Designed analog and digital circuits for low-noise ADC/DAC interfaces and improved signal integrity.
  ● Performed board bring-up, debugging, and failure analysis using oscilloscopes and bench equipment, identifying root causes of failures.
  ● Led motor-control and microcontroller-based product development, validating designs through LTSpice simulation and hardware testing.
  ● Developed modular embedded firmware (C/C++) for ARM MCUs, integrating I2C/SPI/UART peripherals, cut system debugging time by ~50% during integration testing.
  ● Designed multi-layer (Rigid & Flex) PCBs with EMC-conscious layouts, coordinating schematic-to-layout decisions to improve reliability and shorten design iteration cycles by ~30%.
###  Electronics Engineer | Data Communication and Control | 2022 - 2023 | Karachi, Pakistan
  ● Designed and tested high-power inverter and SMPS hardware, supporting motion-control applications and delivering efficient, thermally stable power stages.
  ● Implemented microcontroller control logic for power electronics, validating switching behaviour through bench testing and waveform analysis to ensure reliable operation.
  ● Engineered high-power inverter and SMPS hardware with EMC-aware PCB layouts, delivering robust and efficient power-stage performance.
  ● Supported debugging and fault investigation of power electronics systems, applying root-cause analysis to resolve field and lab failures efficiently.
