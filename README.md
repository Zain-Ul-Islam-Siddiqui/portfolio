##  About Me  
Hi! I’m Zain — an Electronics & Embedded Systems Engineer based in the UK.

I’m a recent University of Liverpool graduate with hands-on experience designing and developing embedded systems, from analog front-end circuits and power electronics to firmware for ARM-based microcontrollers.

My work focuses on building reliable, cost-effective custom hardware through strong fundamentals in PCB design, signal integrity, power electronics, and embedded C/C++. I’ve worked across the full product lifecycle — simulation, schematic capture, PCB layout, board bring-up, and debugging — in both consultancy and freelance environments.

I’m continuously developing my technical depth with the long-term goal of becoming a well-rounded technical lead in embedded and hardware system design.

##  Work Experience
###  Embedded Design Engineer | Upwork & Fiverr | 2022 - Present
